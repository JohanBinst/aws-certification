# 15 - AWS CLI, Dev Tools & CICD

## CI/CD
AWS CodePipeline is used to create a CI/CD pipeline in AWS, a pipeline consists of following steps and uses following AWS Services:
1. Code (CodeCommit): push code to CodeCommit repo
2. Build (CodeBuild): build project using AWS CodeBuild
3. Test (CodeBuild): run test using AWS CodeBuild
4. Deploy (CodeDeploy): Deploy project using AWS CodeDeploy

## AWS CodeCommit
Git repo on AWS

## AWS CodePipeline
AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. You can quickly model and configure the different stages of a software release process. CodePipeline automates the steps required to release your software changes continuously.

- Pipelines are built from **stages**.
- Each stage has 1 or more **actions**, actions can be single (1 action), parallel or sequential.
- Movement between stages can require manual approval
- **Artifacts** are storen in S3 and are the output or input (consumed by action) for an action.
- Stages state changes (success, Failed or Cancelled) are sent to EvenBridge
- Console UI or CloudTrail can be used to view or interact with the pipeline.

## AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you donâ€™t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue

- Pay only for the ressources consumed during builds.
- integrates with other AWS services required for builds : IAM, KMS, VPC, CloudTrail, S3, ...
- Uses Docker by default for build environment but can be customized

Architecture :
- CodeBuild recovers code from git repository : Github, CodeCommit, CodePipeline or S3
- It runs builds and tests (test is build with build environment variables)
- EXAM: It is customized using **buildspec.yaml** file (specific name) that must be in the **root of source**
- build logs can be output to S3 or CloudWatch logs
- build metrics can be stored in CloudWatch
- events related to build can be sent to EventBridge -> event-driven response: eg sent e-mail on build failure or run Lambda function
- build control comes from:
  - CLI
  - SDK
  - Pipeline

### buildspec.yaml file
- buildspec.yaml file customizes build (and test) process
- buildspec file constains:
  - 4 main phases of build process
  - environment variable keys and where to find values
  - info for artifacts
- EXAM: 4 main phases in the file:
  - **install**: install packages in the build environment (frameworks or other toolings (Sonar?)) -> not app dependencies
  - **pre_build**: sign-in to things and install app dependencies
  - **build**: commands run during the build process -> build the actual app
  - **post_build**: do things required after build -> e.g. package things up, push Docker image, explicit notifications
- In buildspec you also define the environment variables required for the build. The values for the variable can come from:
  - shell commands
  - global environment variables
  - AWS Parameter Store
  - AWS Secrets Manager
- Artifacts part of file: Define what to store and where to store it
